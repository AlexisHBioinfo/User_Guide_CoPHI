  <h2>CoPHI : Coordonnées Parallèles pour les réseaux métaboliques</h2>
  <p>
    CoPHI is an interactive visualization system of parallel coordinates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finding reaction patterns through metabolic pathways allows the identification of constraints and interactions between enzymatic reactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Computing Elementary Flux modes is a way to know feasible pathways through a metabolic network. The set size of these feasible pathways requires tools to display results. CoPHI is a user-friendly web application to display set of Elementary Flux modes using a parallel coordinates graph.
